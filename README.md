# speech-recognition-system
A speech recognition system enables control of devices through voice commands. The microphone captures speech, which is processed by a recognition module and an embedded board (Arduino/ESP32). Recognized commands operate devices like lights or fans, offering hands-free, user-friendly control for smart homes and automation.
